		<h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
		<p>My name is Vinay Mishra. I was born in India and moved to USA for higher studies. I did my bachelors and graduate studies in mechanical engineering with specialization in CAD(Computer-Aided Design). Currently, I am a software developer in Solidworks Corporation at Waltham, MA and working on next generation Solidworks CAD product development. </p>
		
		<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
		<p>I have never been exposed to web programming formally and recently in my job, I got a task to reimplement and deploy an existing web functionality for server-side. Even though, I was able to complete the task, but I was not satisfied with my work because I lacked some basics. In this course I want to learn the basic concepts of server side web development so that I can be more efficient in my job.</p>
		
		<h2>What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS?</h2>
		<p>I had attended a 3-day workshop on HTML few years back and I have worked on some job related projects involving HTML/CSS.</p>
		
		<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
		<p>I have been a software developer for past 10+ years. I have used various programming languages, but majorly C and C++.</p>
		
		<h2>Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent?</h2>
		<p>I had worked with PHP for the first time few months back only. I used it for caling some databse web services using SOAP client. I used an existing php function layout, so I can safely say that I don't now much about php.</p>
		
		<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
		<p>I am working on PC (windows 7).</p>
		
		<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
